I used nano to edit the script that my lab partner and I worked on. Our first implementation had bugs in calculating the number of tests run and passed, so I addressed those and then tested the script using three of the given impelementations and our own JUnit tester. As expected, the original implementation results in two failures.

The corrected implementation results in no failures.

The compile-error implementation does not compile, and instead produces the rather harsh error message.
